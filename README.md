# Java-sockets

The code was used in this [article](https://dev.to/saverio683/sockets-in-java-p2d) explaining how to use sockets in Java

## DESCRIPTION

There are 3 folders each containing a chat type using the socket type from the folder name.
These are very simple chats aimed at explaining the operation of each socket.
Anyone who wants to make an improvement or fix a bug is welcome.

## HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN

After cloning the folders, you need to create the respective Java package with the **same name** as the folder.

To run *UDP* and *Multicast* chats, it will just be necessary to run the **UDPHost** and **MulticastHost** classes.
For *TCP* chat you need to run the **TCPServer** class first and then the **TCPClient** class for each client you want to run.
